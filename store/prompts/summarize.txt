You will be provided with a list of news articles, all related to a specific topic. Your task is to analyze the data and produce two outputs:

1. **TRENDS**: Write a concise single-paragraph summary identifying overarching themes, patterns, or trends across the articles. Synthesize insights from the articles and focus on broader patterns rather than listing specific details or events from individual articles.

2. **SUMMARY**: Provide a bullet-point list summarizing the key details or events from the articles. Present these points naturally and directly, without referencing the articles explicitly (e.g., avoid phrases like 'this article mentions').

<Output Format>
